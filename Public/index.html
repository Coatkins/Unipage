<h2>Welcome to Swoon University!</h2>

<p>Visual arts have been practised and taught at Swoon for over a century, and we have an established reputation for creative excellence, which we are always seeking to improve. Our students look at the world differently, questioning conventions, analysing problems, imagining possibilities. They face the 'blank canvas' – both literally and metaphorically – with confidence and experience, crafting ideas and language through a broad range of traditional and contemporary media. As with generations of artists before them, they provide the creative industries with a rich and vital seam of inspiration.</p>
